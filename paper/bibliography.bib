  ABSTRACT = {With the growing application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the legal domain, large language model (LLM)-based legal agents have achieved remarkable progress. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the applications and developments of LLM-driven agents in law. Firstly, we outline the core legal tasks, including legal information retrieval, question answering, judgment prediction, and legal text generation, along with the corresponding evaluation benchmarks. Then, we analyze the technical challenges faced by both single-agent and multi-agent systems in legal scenarios and summarize the prevailing research methods. Finally, we discuss future directions for legal agents, including enhancing single-agent trustworthiness through explainability, boosting multi-agent efficiency with collaborative AI techniques, enabling cross-jurisdictional interoperability via legal knowledge graphs, and establishing ethical governance with quantifiable metrics. By synthesizing existing research, this survey aims to offer theoretical insights and practical guidance for the sustainable advancement of legal agents.},
